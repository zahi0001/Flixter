## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
I faced problems when creating the MovieAdapter.kt class in Android Studio, but then I understood that I shoudl make sure that the class file shoudl be in the same directory as the MainActivity Class to be able to call the method within.
I had a little trouble with finding the gif URL, but I found out I could easily do it without any conversion. Just by right clicking on the gif from the github repository and add ".gif" at the end.

### Open-source libraries used
